Initiative: Create working clone of gym shark that works when hosted locally

Main Goal:
Create a working app by the end of September
Compromises:
1 persistent storage doesnt have to work with individual users
2 style doesnt have to be perfect

Stories:
Users need to be able to login and access their saved workouts and log their reps and sets
Users need to be able to view past workout history which includes reps, sets, date and duration
Users need to be able to create workouts and add exercises
Users need to be able to start a workout, close the app, and have the workout still in progress when reopen it
Users need to be able to sign up with their email address and name

ToDo:
User Stories (Move them to complete when done)
